This section shows users how to setup their environment using your `poetry.lock` file and `environment.yml`.
<details>
<summary><b>Setup Mamba Environment (w/Poetry)</b></summary>
<p>

This project uses a mamba environment.

1. I created the environment with a `--prefix` and not a name, to ensure that it installed in my project directory, not the default path. This is executed in the project root dir.

    ```bash
    # Windows
    mamba env create --prefix ./menv  --file environment.yml

    # MacOS / Linux
    mamba env create --prefix ./menv  --file base-environment.yml
    ```

2. I didn't want the full path to be displayed when using this env so I changed my `.condarc` file to show the env name as the last directory where the env is located.

    ```bash
    conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    ```

3. Activate the environment

    ```bash
    mamba init zsh / mamba init
    mamba activate ./menv
    ```

4. Check if poetry is installed

    ```bash
    mamba install poetry
    poetry --version
    # make sure it is the latest version
    # can use mamba search -f poetry
    ```

5. Install Packages from `poetry.lock`

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

6. If you get an error:

    ```
    EnvCommandError

    Command ['c:\\Users\\<user>\\<path>\\obb\\python.exe', '-m', 'pip', 'uninstall', 'charset-normalizer', '-y'] errored with the following return code 2
    ```

    Then run:

    ```
    pip install charset-normalizer --upgrade
    ```

    and re-run!

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Setup Mamba Environment (w/o Poetry)</b></summary>
<p>

  If you do not use `poetry` for some weird reason, I keep the updated environment specs in an `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt`file in the root of the project.

  I use keep the env. specs up to date. This is packaged in a file `update_reqs.py`

  ```bash
  conda env export | python -c "import sys; print(''.join(line for line in sys.stdin if 'prefix: ' not in line))" > environment.yml
  # This cmd removes the 'prefix:' line to be platform independent.
  conda list  --export > requirements.txt
  ```

### __Setup Conda Env (w/ requirements)__

  This method will be installing dependencies from `requirements.txt || environment.yml`

### __Steps__

  There are two methods to recreating the environment:

- Using requirements.txt

      ```bash
      conda create --name obb --file requirements.txt
      ```

- Using environment.yml (has my path prefix-check the file to change path prefix)

      ```bash
      # Windows
      conda env create --prefix ./obb -f environment.yml

      #Alternative OS
      conda env create --prefix ./obb --file base_environment.yml
      ```

<details>
<summary><b>Setting Up `Commitizen`</b></summary>
<p>
I am using the `vscode-commmitizen` extension to integrate `commitizen` into my workflow.
This allows for nice keyboard shortcuts and UI integration. I have also installed `cz_customizable` globally to allow me to customize the commit message template using `cz-config.js`.

The `pyproject.toml` file has the specifications for `cz_customizable` and `commitizen` to work together.

Follow the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/leoforfree/cz-customizable) and use the 'Quick Start' section to setup `cz-customizable`. You need to install
`cz-customizable` globally in order for the vscode extension to work along with the settings provided in the `pyproject.toml` file.

- [ ] make sure you have a `pre-commit-config.yml`
- [ ] make sure you have a `bumpversion.yml` in `.github/workflows`

## ‚ö°Ô∏è __GitHub Workflow Setup__ <a name = "development_setup"></a>

There are 5 pre-made github actions that are used with this template. SOme require API_KEYS/TOKENS to work. Add your tokens to the secrets manager in your repo settings.

1. `bump.yml`: This workflow automates the versioning of the project using bumpversion.
   - Uses a GitHub `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
2. `deploy.yml`:
   - This workflow is responsible for deploying the project. It is triggered on push events that include tags in the format "v*._._" and also manually through the GitHub Actions UI.
   - The workflow runs on an Ubuntu-latest environment and only if the GitHub reference starts with 'refs/tags/v'.
   - The steps involved in this workflow include:
       - Checking out the repository.
       - Logging into the Docker registry.
       - Setting the Docker image tag.
       - Building and pushing the Docker image.
   - The tokens/secrets used in this workflow include:
       - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This is a GitHub secret used for authentication.
       - `DOCKER_REGISTRY`: This is an environment variable set to 'ghcr.io'.
       - `DEFAULT_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT`: This is an environment variable set to 'feature'.
       - `POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_{{ cookiecutter.private_package_repository_name|slugify(separator="_")|upper }}_USERNAME`: This is a secret used for authentication with the private package repository.
       - `POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_{{ cookiecutter.private_package_repository_name|slugify(separator="_")|upper }}_PASSWORD`: This is a secret used for authentication with the private package repository.
3. `publish.yml`: This workflow is responsible for publishing the project. It is triggered when a new release is created. The workflow runs on an Ubuntu-latest environment.
   - The steps involved in this workflow include:
       - Checking out the repository.
       - Setting up Python with the specified version.
       - Installing Poetry, a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.
       - Publishing the package using Poetry. If a private package repository is specified, the package is published there. Otherwise, it is published to PyPi.
   - The tokens/secrets used in this workflow include:
       - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This is a GitHub secret used for authentication.
       - `POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_{{ cookiecutter.private_package_repository_name|slugify(separator="_")|upper }}_USERNAME`: This is a secret used for authentication with the private package repository.
       - `POETRY_HTTP_BASIC_{{ cookiecutter.private_package_repository_name|slugify(separator="_")|upper }}_PASSWORD`: This is a secret used for authentication with the private package repository.
       - `POETRY_PYPI_TOKEN_PYPI`: This is a secret used for authentication with PyPi, if the package is being published there.
9. `test.yml`: 
   - This workflow is responsible for testing the project. It is triggered on push events to the main and master branches, and on pull requests.
   - The workflow runs on an Ubuntu-latest environment and uses the specified Python version.
   - The steps involved in this workflow include:
       - Checking out the repository.
       - Setting up Node.js with the specified version.
       - Installing @devcontainers/cli.
       - Starting the Dev Container.
       - Linting the package.
       - Testing the package.
       - Uploading coverage.
   - The tokens/secrets used in this workflow include:
       - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This is a GitHub secret used for authentication.

# ----- Extra Info -----

## Python Project Template

This project is a template for creating Python projects that follows the Python Standards declared in PEP 621. It uses a pyproject.yaml file to configure the project and poetry to simplify the build process and publish to PyPI. You can manage all relevant configurations within the pyproject.toml file, streamlining development and promoting maintainability by centralizing project metadata, dependencies, and build specifications in one place.

## Project Organization

- `.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions used for building, testing, and publishing.
- `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`: Contains Dockerfile to build a development container for VSCode with all the necessary extensions for Python development installed.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: Contains the configuration for the development container for VSCode, including the Docker image to use, any additional VSCode extensions to install, and whether or not to mount the project directory into the container.
- `.vscode/settings.json`: Contains VSCode settings specific to the project, such as the Python interpreter to use and the maximum line length for auto-formatting.
- `src`: Place new source code here.
- `tests`: Contains Python-based test cases to validate source code.
- `pyproject.toml`: Contains metadata about the project and configurations for additional tools used to format, lint, type-check, and analyze Python code.
- `.prompts/`: Contains useful prompts to use during development for modifying and generating code and tests.
